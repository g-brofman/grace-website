Map of species richness of Cetaceans along the California coast. Richness is a measure of aggregate species presence as opposed to a single species. A threshold of 0.75 was chosen in order to observe greater detail in species richness patterns, while maintaining coverage for areas of lesser species richness .\n\n\n\nReferences\nKaschner, K., K.
